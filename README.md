# opgeluchteWijk (relieved neighborhood, where the "lucht" inside "opgelucht" also means air)
How to enable (wood)smoke-free neighborhoods without starting new prohibition (there): basically not allow it from the start. So a group of future home owners, or a municipality, or a property developer set strong limits from the get-go and for all future people in that block/neighborhood/area.

This way action can be taken without having to wait for slow politics (in NL only party for the animals is serious on this matter) to do what health and fast-changing climate need NOW. More can be done for clean air and a better neighborhood for enjoying that (For Dutch readers some more detail in "opgeluchte wijk" on https://www.duurzamedinsdag.nl/index.php?id=17171&amp;initiative=15444 )

In case you think wood smoke is not such a serious matter, you should take a look at [https://houtrookvrij.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Bijdrage-uitstoot-consumenten-K-0219-2-liggend.jpg](https://houtrookvrij.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Bijdrage-uitstoot-consumenten-K-0219-2-liggend.jpg)
